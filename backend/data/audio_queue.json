      "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nAfter 14 years as the lead moderator of r/LifeProTips, I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time for me to retire from my role. This community has been a huge part of my life for well over a decade, and I feel incredibly grateful to have watched it grow from a small idea into one of the largest collections of everyday wisdom on Reddit.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve seen countless tips that made me laugh, think, and change the way I go about daily life. More importantly, I\u2019ve seen how this subreddit has connected people all over the world through simple, practical advice. It\u2019s been a privilege to help guide that process and ensure the community stayed true to its purpose.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without all of you, the contributors who keep the spirit of LPT alive, the readers who carry these tips into the real world, and of course, my fellow moderators who will continue to steer this subreddit into the future.\n\nWhile I\u2019ll no longer be serving as lead moderator, I\u2019ll always be cheering this community on from the sidelines.
